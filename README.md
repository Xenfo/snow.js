## What is Snow.JS

Snow.JS is a framework for Discord.JS, largely inspired by Discord-Akairo which unfortunately will not be receiving feature updates anymore.

## Contribution

Snow.JS is open to contributions, but I recommend opening an issue on GitHub with your idea before implementing it so that you can receive feedback.
